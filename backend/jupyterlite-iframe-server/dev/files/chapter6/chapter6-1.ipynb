This normally means: when a condition  is true, you would want to do one thing, otherwise you would do another thing.  Let's focus on how to define logical conditions with boolean variables in this video.\n\nA boolean is a type of variable with one of two possible values: True or False. You  can think of this as the answer to a Yes or No question.\n\nSimilar as we store strings or numbers into string or number variables, you can store  results of logical conditions to a boolean variable. If you are curious with why it  is called \"Boolean\", it is because this type of variable is named after a mathematician  named George Boole.\n\n##### Here are a few examples on how you can assign values to boolean variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Note the variables referenced on the right side of the equal sign need to be\n# assigned values beforehand (ex.
