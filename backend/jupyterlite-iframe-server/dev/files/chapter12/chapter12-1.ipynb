Today, we're going to learn about a magical sequence called the **Fibonacci Sequence**. It's super cool and easy to understand. Let's dive in!\n\n## What is the Fibonacci Sequence?\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\n\nThe Fibonacci Sequence is a list of numbers where each number is the **sum of the two numbers before it**. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then continues like this:\n\n\n\n### How does it work?\n- Start with **0** and **1**.\n- Add the two numbers to get the next one:  \n  `0 + 1 = 1`  \n- Then add the last two numbers again:  \n  `1 + 1 = 2`  \n  `1 + 2 = 3`  \n  `2 + 3 = 5`  \n  And so on!\n\nEach number is built on the two numbers before it. üßÆ\n\n---\n\n## Why is the Fibonacci Sequence Important?\n\n1. **Nature loves Fibonacci** üåø  \n   You can find this sequence in flower petals, tree branches, pinecones, and even the spirals of shells and galaxies.  \n\n2. **Learning Programming** üíª  \n   Writing code for the Fibonacci Sequence is a great way to practice **loops**, **functions**, and working with **lists** in Python.\n\n3. **Problem Solving Skills** üß†  \n   Understanding this sequence helps you think logically and break problems into smaller steps.\n\n---\n\n## Let‚Äôs Write the Fibonacci Sequence in Python!\n\nIn the next code cell, we‚Äôll create a function that generates the Fibonacci Sequence. You can adjust the number of terms (`n`) to see more or fewer numbers in the sequence.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    result = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        result.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    return result\n\nprint(\"The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are:\", fibonacci_sequence(10))\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
