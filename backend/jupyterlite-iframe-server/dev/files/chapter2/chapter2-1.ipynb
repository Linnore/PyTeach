    "## Chapter 2: Strings\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you learned what a computer program was and accomplished  writing your first Python program. As you may recall, \"Hello Kids Python\" is  called a string in Python. Basically, a string is a sequence of characters  enclosed in double (\") or single quotes ('). Either single quotes, double quotes,  or triple quotes work for defining strings. It can be a single character, a word,  a phrase, a sentence or even the content of a whole book. A string's length is  only limited by the RAM (Radon Access Memory) on the computer you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store any information you want in a string. Month can be considered as a  string, for example \"February\" is a string. Or, color names are also  strings, \"red\", \"blue\" and so on. Sentences can also be strings, for example  \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", or \"This is a very very very very  very long sentence\" are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples of the mentioned strings."
