As you may recall, \"Hello Kids Python\" is  called a string in Python. Basically, a string is a sequence of characters  enclosed in double (\") or single quotes ('). Either single quotes, double quotes,  or triple quotes work for defining strings. It can be a single character, a word,  a phrase, a sentence or even the content of a whole book. A string's length is  only limited by the RAM (Radon Access Memory) on the computer you use.\n\nYou can store any information you want in a string. Month can be considered as a  string, for example \"February\" is a string. Or, color names are also  strings, \"red\", \"blue\" and so on. Sentences can also be strings, for example  \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", or \"This is a very very very very  very long sentence\" are strings.\n\nHere are examples of the mentioned strings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"'This is a string with single quote'\n\"This is a string with double quotes\"\n'''This is a string with triple quotes'''\n\"\"\"This is a another string with triple quotes\"\"\"\n\"February\"\n\"red\"\n\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now you may wonder if it is allowed to mix different types of quotes in a string?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Is this a correct string?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is not allowed.

I want  to teach you two string operators today: The addition operator (+) for  concatenating strings and the multiplication operator (*) for repeating a string.\n\nTwo or more strings can be concatenated to form a new and longer string, by using  the plus sign (+). Similar to how the addition operator can be used to add 2  numbers, the addition operator (+) can be used to join 2 strings together.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Kids \" + \"love \" + \"Python\")\nprint(\"Kids love Python\")\nprint(\"These two strings are the same\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that you need to put white spaces in between your words or sentences when  you concatenate strings to separate them, just like how you use white spaces to  separate words in English when you write.
