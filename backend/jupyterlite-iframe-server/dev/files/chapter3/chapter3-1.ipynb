So what can you do with \"numbers\" in Python? Actually you can  use Python as a calculator, that supports more operators with numbers than with strings.\n\n- **+**: addition operator, e.g. 2 + 2 = 4\n- **-**: subtraction operator, e.g. 10 - 6 = 4\n- **\\***: multiplication operator, e.g. 5 * 6 = 30\n- **/**: division operator, e.g. 8 / 4 = 2\n\nThese four operators work exactly the same as common math operators. You can use the print  function to print out the results of these operations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(2 + 2)\nprint(10 - 6)\nprint(5 * 6)\nprint(8 / 4)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For more complicated operations you can use parentheses ( () ) to group sub expressions.
