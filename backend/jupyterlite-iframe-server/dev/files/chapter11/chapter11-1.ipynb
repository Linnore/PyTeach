    "Once a specific task is defined for a function, you can follow these steps to write the function:\n",
    "1. Define the function name, and make it meaningful.\n",
    "2. Decide what parameters to be passed in, and give them meaningful names.\n",
    "3. Decide what result the function needs to return, or returns no result.\n",

    "Let's start with a simple task that requires writing a function for calculating the area of a rectangle.\n",
    "- Step 1: The function can be named as `area`, that is meaningful and calls out what task the function is for.\n",
    "- Step 2: To calculate the area of a rectangle, we need to know its width and height that can be defined as parameters.\n",
    "- Step 3: This function needs to return the calculated area as a result.\n",
    "- Step 4: In this example, the code block can be simplified to contain only the return statement. Since rectangle area is calculated as `width * height`, we can write the code block as `return width * height`. And here is the full implementation of this `area` function.\n",
