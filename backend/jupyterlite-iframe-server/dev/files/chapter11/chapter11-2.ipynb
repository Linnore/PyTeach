    "- Step 3: The function needs to return the reversed string as a result.\n",
    "- Step 4: To reverse a string, we can either iterate from the beginning of the string or from  the end (by using the negative index numbers). Let's try the first approach that iterates the  string from left to right. We can create a result variable that holds an empty string at the  beginning, then when the for loop iterates the string and retrieves a character, we add the  character to the beginning of the result variable. When the for loop ends, the result variable  will contain the reversed string and will be returned.\n",
